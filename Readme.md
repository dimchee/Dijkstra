# Dijkstra's Legacy

- "Simple language not meant for real implementation'' (challenge accepted :smiley:)

## Why new language?

### Different view of programming

> I view a programming language primarily as a vehicle for the description

Edsger W. Dijkstra

### Why so simple?

> When starting on a book like this, one is immediately faced with the
> question: "Which programming language am I going to use?", and this is not
> a mere question of presentation! A most important, but also a most elusive,
> aspect of any tool is its influence on the habits of those who train themselves
> in its use. If the tool is a programming language, this influence is -whether
> we like it or not- an influence on our thinking habits. Having analyzed that
> influence to the best of my knowledge, I had come to the conclusion that
> none of the existing programming languages, nor a subset of them, would
> suit my purpose; on the other hand I knew myself so unready for the design
> of a new programming language that I had taken a vow not to do so for the
> next five years, and I had a most distinct feeling that that period had not
> yet elapsed! (Prior to that, among many other things, this monograph had to
> be written.) I have tried to resolve this conflict by only designing a mini-
> language suitable for my purposes, by making only those commitments
> that seemed unavoidable and sufficiently justified.
> This hesitation and self-imposed restriction, when ill-understood, may
> make this monograph disappointing for many of its potential readers. It will
> certainly leave all those dissatisfied who identify the difficulty of program-
> ming with the difficulty of cunning exploitation of the elaborate and baroque
> tools known as "higher level programming languages" or -worse!-
> "programming systems". When they feel cheated because I just ignore all those
> bells and whistles, I can only answer: "Are you quite sure that all those bells
> and whistles, all those wonderful facilities of your so-called "powerful" pro-
> gramming languages belong to the solution set rather than to the problem
> set?". I can only hope that, in spite of my usage of a mini-language, they will
> study my text; after having done so, they may agree that, even without the
> bells and the whistles, so rich a subject remains that it is questionable whether
> the majority of the bells and the whistles should have been introduced in the
> first place. And to all readers with a pronounced interest in the design of pro-
> gramming languages, I can only express my regret that, as yet, I do not feel
> able to be much more explicit on that subject; on the other hand I hope that,
> for the time being, this monograph will inspire them and will enable them
> to avoid some of the mistakes they might have made without having read it.
